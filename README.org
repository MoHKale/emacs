* My Literate Emacs Configuration
  *TODO*: add screenshot

** requirements
   This emacs configuration requires:
   - emacs >= 26.1
   - ruby >= 2.6 (optional)

** building
   1. run ~git clone "https://github.com/mohkale/.emacs.d" ~/.emacs.d~ to clone this
      repository to your dotemacs directory.
   2. open ~init.org~ in emacs and run ~M-x org-babel-tangle~ to tangle the configuration.

*** too slow
    I find the previous process to be quite slow on sufficiently large org files, especially
    on windows emacs. For me it can take upto 10 minutes. That's why I created a tangle script
    in ~bin/tangle~ that spawns an unconfigured emacs process and has it tangle the config
    instead. To run the script you'll need ruby installed. Run the script from a shell and you
    should get a working ~init.el~ file much quicker than through emacs directly.
